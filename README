<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<layman>
	<overlay
		type   = "git"
		src    = "git@github.com:aniederl/overlays-misc.git"
		status = "unofficial"
		name   = "aniederl-misc">

		<description>
			Overlay containing miscellaneous packages not included in the portage tree
		</description>
	</overlay>
</layman>

Add it to the overlay lists in /etc/layman/layman.conf as shown in the example comment.
